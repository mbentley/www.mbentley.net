                            <p class="left">I live in Greenwood, Indiana and lived around Indy for my whole life.  I live with my
                            wife, Danielle, and our son, Graham.  Around here, there is never a dull moment.  I've worked mostly
                            with Docker and Kubernetes for the last several years at Docker, Mirantis, and now VMware.  At work, all
                            I look for is to work with smart, awesome, and passionate people; anything else is a bonus. I've always
                            been interested in technology, science, and love to tinker.  Being a pre-sales engineer is just one of
                            those things that happened to me and ended up being a good fit.  I like technology and find myself
                            excited to help people with it.<br /><br />
                            I'm a little bit of everywhere when it comes to social media but don't necessarily spend much
                            time anywhere in particular.  My thoughts shared on social media are my own and not those of my
                            employer.  When I'm not traveling for work, I love to play PC games, enjoy many sports, and relaxing
                            with my family.
                            </p>

                            <p class="left">I'm not a programmer or web designer; never have been and probably never will be.
                            Shocking, I know.  I've spent most of my career focused on the operations side of things but I'm
                            interested in all sorts of computer related technology.  Docker is what most of my projects are focused on
                            these days.  As you can see from my <a href="https://github.com/mbentley?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=docker-&type=&language=">
                              GitHub repo list</a>, I have many that are just apps which I have Dockerized or some overblown
                            shell script that should really be written in a proper language.  There is something that I find
                            fun about and challenging about putting anything in a Docker container.  You might be able to see
                            that I've been all over the board from my <a href="https://blog.mbentley.net">past blog posts</a>.<br /><br />
                            The biggest exception to that rule is that I love to write tools in bash.  To me, bash feels
                            natural because of how I can easily read it and it just makes sense.  One of my favorite projects
                            is <a href="https://github.com/mbentley/docker-in-docker">docker-in-docker</a> just because
                            of how powerful it can be to run many Docker engines inside one.  It's so much faster than
                            spinning up VMs and uses such a small footprint resource wise.  It's great for prototyping
                            and testing on a system with limited resources.</p>

                            <p class="left">I still keep <a href="https://blog.mbentley.net">my blog</a> up but I haven't
                            added any content in quite some time as I am simply too busy with work.  It's not that I do
                            not want to blog but it's purpose was to write up things where I had difficulty finding
                            online resources.  There wasn't really a point to writing up things that you could easily
                            Google.  If I end up writing anything that could be a blog, it is typically work related for
                            a customer anyway.  You'll probably find the few interesting things I am working on by checking
                            out <a href="https://github.com/mbentley/">my GitHub</a>.</p>
