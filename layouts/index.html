							<p class="left">I live in Greenwood, Indiana and lived around Indy for my whole life.  I live with my
                                                        wife, Danielle, and our son, Graham.  Around here, there is never a dull moment.  I've worked
                                                        at a number of places but have spent the last several years at Docker.  All I ever really ask for
                                                        at work is that I work with awesome and passionate people and the rest I can deal with. I've
                                                        always been interested in technology, science, and love to tinker.<br /><br />
                                                        I'm a little bit of everywhere when it comes to social media but don't necessarily spend much
                                                        time on any one in particular.  My thoughts shared on social media are my own and not those of my
                                                        employer.  When I'm not traveling for work, I love to play PC games, enjoy many sports, and relaxing
                                                        with my family.<br /><br />
                                                        </p>

							<p class="left">I'm not a programmer or web designer; never have been and probably never will be but I'm
                                                        always interested in technology both new and old.  Docker is what most of my projects are
                                                        about these days; as you can see from my <a href="https://github.com/mbentley?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=docker-&type=&language=">
                                                          GitHub repo list</a>, I have many that are simply apps which I have Dockerized.  There is
                                                        something that I find fun about and challenging about putting anything in a Docker container.
                                                        You might be able to see that I've been all over the board from my <a href="https://blog.mbentley.net">
                                                          past blog posts</a>.<br /><br />
                                                        One thing is for sure and that is that I love to write scripts in bash.  To me, bash feels
                                                        natural because of how I can read it and it just makes sense.  One of my favorite projects
                                                        is <a href="https://github.com/mbentley/docker-in-docker">docker-in-docker</a> just because
                                                        of how powerful it can be to run many Docker engines inside one.  It's so much faster than
                                                        spinning up VMs and uses such a small footprint resource wise.  It's great for prototyping
                                                        and testing on a system with limited resources.</p>

                                                        <p class="left">I still keep <a href="https://blog.mbentley.net">my blog</a> up but I haven't
                                                        added any content in quite some time as I am simply too busy with work.  It's not that I do
                                                        not want to blog but it's purpose was to write up things where I had difficulty finding
                                                        online resources.  There wasn't really a point to writing up things that you could easily
                                                        Google.  If I end up writing anything for a blog, it is typically work related on
                                                        <a href="https://blog.docker.com">blog.docker.com</a> anyway.  You'll probably find the few
